### Iztočnica
In the first year you encountered maximum-flow algorithms. Implement it and run experiments on simple classes of graphs. For example, consider planar grids with random removal of edges/vertices. How does the value of the maximum flow depend on the number of removed elements or the probability of removal of each single element? You can also consider random geometric graphs: points are selected at random in the unit square and connect a pair of them when their distance is smaller than r. You can also consider the version where each edge is oriented in only one direction chosen at random. In short: implement a max-flow algorithm and make experiments on parameterized scenarios.
